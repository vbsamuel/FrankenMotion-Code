## 📄 Abstract
Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts.

In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce **FrankenMotion**, a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms previous baseline models and can compose motions unseen during training.
